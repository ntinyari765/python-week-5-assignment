# 🌸 Flowers Class Assignment

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python using a `Flower` class.  
It focuses on **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, showing how different flower types share the same methods (`bloom()`, `fragrance()`) but behave differently.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Base Class (`Flower`)**: Defines common attributes (name, color, season) and general methods.
- **Child Classes (`Rose`, `Daisy`)**: Inherit from `Flower` and override methods to provide unique behaviors.
- **Polymorphism**: The same method name has different implementations depending on the flower type.

## 📂 Files
- `class.py` → Main Python script with the flower classes and
-  `polymorphism.py` → Ppolymorphism example.
- `README.md` → Project documentation.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
2. Run the script in your terminal:

```bash
python class.py
```
